I have created or updated most of these mods, and when I haven't, credit goes to the original author. If you are the creator of one of the mods that lacks credits, please inform me; I found some on the web as they are.

Most of the mods are optimized for 3440x1440. Any help or suggestions will be appreciated.

To install the mods, open Yuzu, right-click on the game for which you want to install the mod, open the mod data location, and then extract the zip file there.

If you encounter any issues with the mods, please let me know.

I will include 30/60/120/144/240 FPS mods when available inside the ultrawide mods zip, same with resolution mods.
