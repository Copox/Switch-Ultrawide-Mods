Collection of Switch Ultrawide Mods, i did most of them, and when i didnt, the credit goes to the original author,
most of the mods are optimized for 3440x1440, any help or suggestion will be appreciated.

To install the mods, just open the Yuzu, right click on the game you want to install the mod, open mod data location, then just extract the zip there.
