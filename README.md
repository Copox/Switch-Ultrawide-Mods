Collection of Switch Ultrawide Mods, i did/updated most of them, and when i didnt, the credit goes to the original author, if you are the creator of one of the mods that didnt have the credits, just let me know, i just found some on the web as it is.

Most of the mods are optimized for 3440x1440, any help or suggestion will be appreciated.

To install the mods, just open the Yuzu, right click on the game you want to install the mod, open mod data location, then just extract the zip there.

If you find any issue with the mods just let me know.

Will add the 60 FPS mods when available inside the ultrawide mods zip.
